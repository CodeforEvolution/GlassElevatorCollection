# The Haiku Glass Elevator Collection (R2 Brainstorming)
* This will soon become the (temporary) home of misplaced information, brainstorming, and discussions for Haiku's Glass Elevator project. None of the files here are my own, this is a collection after all.


### What's Haiku?
* Oh, just a pretty cool, open-source, free, and desktop-oriented operating system found here: https://www.haiku-os.org/

* Inspired by, and binary compatible with the Be Operating System (specifically BeOS R5): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS

* It's not Linux, not BSD, and not based anything else you could imagine! (In other words, from scratch!)


### What's the Glass Elevator Project?
* Early in the development of the Haiku operating system, people of the community were already looking far ahead into the future, before Haiku was even in an alpha state.

* On forums around 2002-2007 (I believe?), people proposed creative, unique, and revolutionary ideas for what the Haiku operating system could be!

* From user experience to optimizations, from applications to the kernel, all sorts of ideas were proposed.


### Sounds cool...so, uh, what happened after?
* Unfortunately, the Haiku project (as of July 2020) has only recently released its second beta. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing to see how far the project has come over the years with just a few developers. In general, it's just amazing to see such a project even exist in the modern day!

* Here's the two main problem (as I see it): The project just can't catch a break when it comes to developers willing to learn and touch the Haiku code-base, and previous developers with lots of experience usually have to leave due to (for a lack of better words) life.

* Thankfully, Haiku is an open-source project that has no deadline, does not exist to make a profit, and backed by (at least) a few developers who want to see it become used by lots of people in their daily lives. One day...

### What's happening here?
* Honestly, this is pretty anti-climatic after that emotional speech :) , but I'm just dumping R2 Glass Elevator forums here that are currently scattered on the Internet Archive and elsewhere.

* These may be moved to the Haiku website within a museum section (which I hope to create, other Haiku developers aren't aware that this repo exists...yet?), or possibly even the bug tracker. I mean, these discussions are all just enhancement tickets waiting to be filed :) .

### Can I help?
* Of course!!! :D

* I'm still figuring out how I want this to all be organized (trust me, it's going to quickly become a mess). Though when I do, I'll probably create one of those "CONTRIBUTING.md" files to explain.

* For now, feel free to search the web for R2 article locations and file issues!

* Or...if you have your own ideas for R2...you could file them here. :P (Or, using the Haiku bugtracker wouldn't hurt either: https://dev.haiku-os.org/)
