Cause i was upset how the new Leopard handles multimonitor (out of the 
box), i thought about a better way for haiku.
I think it would be intuitiv, if you can choose a Workspace to be 
rendert to a extarnal Monitor.
e.g. by default Workspace 2 is shown on the first external Monitor, 
Workspace 3 on the second and so on.
I think this is how the user would expect it.


Switiching the workspaces will only work on the "first" the main Monitor.
So if the main Monitor shows Workspace 1 the hole System works kind of 
an expanded Desktop. If the User switch to Workspace 2 it works like a 
mirrored Deskop.

I guess this will be hard to implement.. but i think it will be such a 
pleasure.

There must be some aditional settings, eg. if you wanne show the Deskbar 
on the external Monitor and also to set the main Monitor.

For the Mediaplayer it would be intuitiv, that it start Video on the 
exteranal Monitor, if one is connected. (beacuse normally this means 
someone attached a better Monitor.. and want to look on this Monitor 
videos (like beamer or so.)) The Controlpanel still can sit on the Main 
Monitor.

This are just my ideas, i am not so shure if someone already had made 
this suggestions...
Sorry for my bad english :)

I actually love the way leopard handles multiple monitors with workspaces.

I would appreciate if I could easily send applications to other spaces, though.

Leopard  wasnt my point :) it was just the trigger. And the workspaces 
worke like Haiku. Grab a Window and change to the workspace where it 
should go :) and then realeas the Window.

What i didnt loved was that Leopard cloned/mirrored my Screen to the 
external VideoBeamer with full resolution 1440 x 900 wich my Beamer 
really dont support.
This  is for me  an really "unitelligent" solution. And i also dont want 
to show my Desktop to people in a Meeting.

And also if you have some "virtual Screens" -> Workspaces, it seems to 
me, That the average User the first thing   that they can make a "real" 
screen out of it, if they attach a real Screen to the Monitor..

You are actually misinterpreting what a Workspace is about - it's your 
complete working environment, and that always spans over all monitors 
attached to the system.
Of course, it doesn't have to be a clone by default (but you can easily 
switch that in Mac OS, too).

Bye,
   Axel.

I think/hope i dont  misinterpret what workspaces are about, i used them 
extensive
on BeOS and Linux.

But i think we have an "System-side" view but not the "user-side" one.

So why not expand this common konzept. (being innovative :-D)
I think this could be the easier way for the user to set up their 
external Monitors.

For me, as i used to multimedia stuff (rundumvideo and so on :))
it would helped me so much, if i could have such a system...
eg.: Running my presentation on a external Monitor wich "acts" like a 
workspace
 and switch to "clone" mode with simply changing the workspace on my 
main Monitor, without affecting the Presentation.
Or even better...running 4 different Videos on four different Screens by 
simply draggin them to workspace 2,3,4,5 :)

just thoughts :) in verry bad english :)

I am also aware that i can change the setting :-D in Mac OSX :).

Not sure if I understand you correctly (and it's not a language issue :
-)).
If you want to switch the presentation to be a clone of another screen 
by switching the workspace, then that is exactly what this definition 
allows you to do.
If you want to say "leave this monitor to workspace 2 no matter what I 
do" then this is not possible, even though I can imagine it being 
useful. But it could be solved to temporarily override the workspace 
settings for that monitor, and have the window shown on all workspaces 
- at least I can imagine that we might want to implement that feature.

There would be no difference to letting them run on a single workspace, 
just on different screens.

Bye,
   Axel.
