Hi All.

We had a serious problem with the BUG-Br server and the end result was 
the fact that the entire server (software-wise and data-wise) has been 
lost. I had to reinstall everything from scratch and ended up upgrading 
the mailing list software which is not directly compatible with the 
previous version. I am having to manually rebuild all lists and this is 
taking a lot of time (as I can only do that on my free time).

I just "recovered" the glasselevator-talk list but with som side-
effects:

1 - Archives are lost for now. I have them on backups but I need to 
figure out a way to import the archives from the previous version of 
the mailing list software into the new version. I won't be doing that 
until I have all the missing lists back up.

2 - If you had 2 addresses subscribed to the list and one was set to 
"no mail", this flag has been lost. The end result is that you will 
start receiving emails on all addresses that are subscribed. If this 
happens to you, let me know and I will sort it up (or you can do it 
yourself if you know how to use the Mailman web interface.

That's it for now. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please spread the world 
and let people know that the missing lists (like bedevtalk, beuser-talk 
and others) will be back as soon as possible.

-Bruno

Good point.  I was thinking of links to put the app in multiple menu
folders (so it shows up in different menu categories) and it didn't
occur to me that the menu folder and the app would be on different
drives.  Removeable drives are even more tricky!

As I mentioned before I like like to organize my apps into categories. 
However, I do not want apps auto-assigned to predefined categories.  If this 
is done I would have to spend time searching for it.  It's hard enough to 
find newly installed apps when they create a folder using the companies name 
and then put the app under that (I think this is done a lot more in windows 
then in Be).  When I manually move an app into a category I know where I 
moved it so I won't have to search.

If anyone is curious these are the categories I use.

Development
Games
Media
Network
Productivity
---Development
Startup
System
---Accessories
---Administrative Tools
---Antispyware
---Antivirus
---Codecs
---Device Drivers
---Maintenance, Tuneup, Cleanup
Utilities

Obviously, this is from windows.  I have a very similar structure in Be.  Of 
course some apps don't clearly fit into one category so I have those copied 
to each category they could go into.  I even have a duplicate development 
category.

My main reason for organizing my apps like this is so I don't have giant 
menu that has over 100 items and to reduce the amount of searching I have to 
do.  It's not really to quickly access programs.  In windows, I have all the 
programs I use frequently or sometimes use on the quicklaunch on the 
taskbar.  So to start any program I want is a single click.  In Be, I have 
keyboard shortcuts setup with SpicyKeys.

I couple of very basic categories could be used that would only contain apps 
that wouldn't make sense to be in the other categories.  Probably Games, 
Programs, and System.  However, anyone should be able to move apps to 
whatever category they want.


Later,
Scott

If you have only a few categories that _are_ universally valid (Games 
is one example), you will not see this.

I personally think this is way too much. What's the difference between 
"Antispyware"/"Antivirus" and "Maintenance, Tuneup, Cleanup"? And how 
come "Codec" has its own folder? Shouldn't that be in the system 
preferences, if need to be exposed at all? Also, why two Development 
categories?

I opt for /not/ doing fine-grained categories.

Agreed. I will repeat my last suggestion:

Every app may be in one the following three categories:
* Applications
* Games
* Preferences
Apps that don't specify a category are not shown in the Deskbar.
To make all installed software still accessible from an intuitive place 
(for uninstall and inspection of installed software) the "Applications" 
menu in Deskbar gets an entry "Show All Applications" (placed at the top 
and separated from the other entries). This entry opens the "Software 
Manager" which should look like an application launcher, but also allow 
for inspecting all installed bundles and packages.

If you want categories then create a folder on the desktop containing 
subfolders with bundles or links to your applications. Right-click the 
desktop and browse that folder to get a categorized view of your 
applications. I'm not so sure about allowing categories within Deskbar 
because on multi-user systems you cannot suit everyone and for 
administrators it's easier to live with a uniform scheme on all computers.

Bye,
Waldemar
